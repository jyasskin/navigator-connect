        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This document will use the term <code><dfn>navigator.connect</dfn>()</code> to refer to the
        notional API that allows cross-origin communication between service workers and web pages.
        This isn't intended to presuppose the final shape of the API, although we don't know of any
        alternate proposals.

        Use-Cases

      <section id='analytics'>
        <h2>
          Offline Analytics
        </h2>
        <p>
          Third party analytics platforms expose their services via REST interfaces. Thus, these
          platforms are unable to provide insights about offline behavior. As <a>Service
          Worker</a>s and offline web apps become more prevalent, the need for analytics platforms
          that function offline will continue to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code><a>navigator.connect</a></code> enables third party analytics platforms to register
          <a>Service Worker</a>s that expose APIs to track metrics both online and offline. These
          <a>Service Worker</a>s are then able to report these metrics when connectivity is
          reestablished so that they can be consumed by the developer. Furthermore, this reporting
          can be implemented with background sync to take advantage of times when the user’s
          experience will not be impacted—for example, avoiding saturating the network with
          non-essential requests when the user is struggling with poor connectivity or on a heavily
          metered/throttled mobile plan. Thus, exposing analytics APIs via <a>Service Worker</a>s
          allows third party analytics platforms to reduce their performance costs even when
          online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that without <code><a>navigator.connect</a></code>, a web app frontend could report
          metrics to an analytics platform <a>Service Worker</a> via communication through an
          iframe. However, a web app’s <a>Service Worker</a> would not be able to communicate with
          the analytics platform in this way. Web app <a>Service Worker</a>s perform crucial
          tasks—both online and offline—that are valuable for developers to track.
          <code><a>navigator.connect</a></code> enables the <a>Service Worker</a> to <a>Service
          Worker</a> communication that is necessary for this robust web app analytics model.

      <section id='storage'>
        <h2>
          Cloud Storage Platforms
        </h2>
        <p>
          Suppose Google Drive offers a <a>Service Worker</a> that provides access to the user’s
          files in the cloud, as well as a caching mechanism that keeps high priority files
          available for offline access. We want to implement a web app for offline document reading
          on both mobile and desktop called Readle.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the user saves an online document to Readle, Readle’s <a>Service Worker</a> loads
          the document into temporary storage and uses the Drive API—exposed by the Drive
          <a>Service Worker</a> via <code><a>navigator.connect</a></code>—to save the document to
          the cloud. Without <code><a>navigator.connect</a></code>, Readle’s frontend would have to
          take care of this work, and the saving of a large document could be interrupted if the
          frontend were closed prematurely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a document is saved to Drive, it is added to a queue of documents to read with
          Readle. On desktop, hard drive space can be plentiful, so Readle keeps many documents in
          the Drive <a>Service Worker</a>’s cache. On mobile, storage is a scarcer resource, so
          Readle selectively tells the Drive <a>Service Worker</a> to cache only the next few
          documents in the queue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose the user reads a few documents from the top of Readle’s queue on her desktop. In
          a world without <code><a>navigator.connect</a></code>, Readle on the user’s mobile device
          can’t start syncing the new top of the queue until the frontend is loaded. With
          <code><a>navigator.connect</a></code>, Readle can use push messaging to send the new top
          of the queue to its mobile <a>Service Worker</a>, which can then notify the Drive
          <a>Service Worker</a> which new documents to cache. With sufficient notice, Drive's
          <a>Service Worker</a> can intelligently pull down these files in the background such that
          they are available quickly and offline the next time the user opens Readle on the mobile
          web.

      <section id='fonts'>
        <h2>
          Shared Fonts
        </h2>
        <p>
          Fonts are a shared resource where latency is critical. People expect the text on a web
          page to be readable while the images and/or videos load. Latin fonts are 50-200 KB and
          download in 0.5 to 1.0 seconds, which is sluggish but acceptable. Chinese/Japanese/Korean
          (CJK) fonts are 4-20 MB and download in 10 to 30+ seconds, which is unacceptably slow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having a way to preload and persist fonts locally provides a much better user experience
          for CJK (and also Latin) users. The browser cache provides a rudimentary persistence
          mechanism, allowing a font drawn from a given URL to be retrieved from the server once
          and served locally many times. However, the browser cache falls short in many dimensions.
          For example, the font cannot be pre-fetched when bandwidth is abundant; it must be
          retrieved from the server the first time it is requested, leading to poor first-load
          performance for the requesting web page. Since the cached font cannot be updated
          automatically as soon as the cache becomes stale, this load performance hit is
          experienced whenever the font changes. Additionally, when the cache is stale, the entire
          font must be refreshed, as opposed to efficiently downloading the deltas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively to the browser cache, local persistence mechanisms such as IndexedDB can be
          used to reduce redundant font requests over the network. However, such local persistence
          mechanisms are domain specific: if the same font is used in multiple domains, it must be
          persisted separately for each domain.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, a cross domain service can reduce unnecessary latency and storage costs for
          fonts (and other such shared resources) with greater customized intelligence than the
          browser cache. Such a cross domain service can be implemented in the form of a fonts
          <a>Service Worker</a> and <code><a>navigator.connect</a></code> protocols. This
          implementation opens up additional opportunities as well. For instance, the fonts
          <a>Service Worker</a> can use the background sync API to schedule rationalization and
          optimization work when the network and CPU are idle, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Optimizing the cache for efficiency by removing rarely used fonts
          </li>
          <li>Fetching complete fonts to replace previously downloaded subsets
          </li>
          <li>Updating fonts to their newest versions
          </li>
          <li>Automatically fetching the most popular fonts for a given user
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that a shared fonts service could be implemented without
          <code><a>navigator.connect</a></code>, although it would be quite awkward. With
          <code><a>navigator.connect</a></code>, the optimization can happen in the background,
          with a web app’s <a>Service Worker</a> handling the front end’s font request and
          communicating with the shared fonts <a>Service Worker</a> as necessary. In this way,
          <code><a>navigator.connect</a></code> enables a transparent and elegant solution that
          avoids the need to alter CSS loading.
        </p>
        <p class='issue'>
          TODO(slightlyoff): add more details on the difference between the with- and
          without-<code><a>navigator.connect</a></code> implementations.

        <h2>
          Extending the Platform
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>This use case is unlikely to drive aspects of the proposed API. We will need detailed
          analysis of how to make this use safe for the web before recommending it.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Browser vendors would like to have a way to experiment with APIs that access new platform
          features. Dimitri Glazkov has a <a href="https://github.com/dglazkov/tubes">proposal</a>
          to use a <code><a>navigator.connect</a></code>-like API to "drill through the bedrock" by
          connecting to a system-provided endpoint. The idea is that, for proposed APIs that can
          afford <code>postMessage</code> overhead on every call, the browser would define that
          <code>navigator.connect('https://browser.example.com/path/theNewApiName')</code> connects
          to code built into the browser instead of to a normal <a>Service Worker</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with the other use cases, this can be accomplished for foreground tabs using an
          <code>&lt;iframe src="<var>implementation://defined.uri/</var>"&gt;</code> combined with
          <code>postMessage</code>. <code><a>navigator.connect</a></code> is required to do the
          same thing from a Worker.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a risk that when a browser defines a URL endpoint for
          <code><a>navigator.connect</a></code>, websites will become dependent on that endpoint in
          the same way they became dependent on vendor-prefixed Javascript and CSS names. The
          browser may then be unable to remove or change the meaning of that URL, negating the
          benefit of using <code><a>navigator.connect</a></code> to experiment. We can mitigate
          this in a few ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Web developers already have experience with resources behind URLs disappearing or
          changing, so they may spontaneously write pages that are more resilient.
          </li>
          <li>We could include a rotating identifier in the path to the API. If this identifier
          changes frequently, developers who aren't actively maintaining their sites won't have
          time to build up to the point that it constrains the browser. The rotating identifier
          could be either a counter/version number or a string that's randomly generated at each
          rotation. Developers who want to avoid needing to maintain their use of the experimental
          API could write a function to search for the newest version number, but this would be
          impossible with the random string.
          </li>
        </ul>

        Security and Privacy Considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        User agents should not leak any information on sites a user has visited etc to other
        webpages, unless the visited site opts in. In particular this means that a service
        rejecting a connection attempt should be indistinguishable from no service being installed
        to service a particular URL.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
        If attempting to connect to a service can trigger installation of a service worker, we need
        to fill in the security and privacy concerns around doing that.
